## Task

The education industry is tapping into the digital revolution, transforming how students learn, how professors teach, and how higher ed institutions operate. With customized learning experiences at the forefront, the industry is seeing increased attention on gamification, digital classrooms, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and more.

While this brings many positives, there are also challenges involved in integrating tech into higher education. IT challenges come in many forms, and administrators may be unprepared to handle them without performing their due diligence. many positives, there are also challenges involved in integrating tech into higher education.
